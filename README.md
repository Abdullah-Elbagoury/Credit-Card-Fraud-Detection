# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using advanced preprocessing and ensemble learning, it tackles class imbalance for accurate predictions.

## Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Normalized features, encoded categorical variables, and handled missing data.
2. **Balancing Classes**: Used SMOTE and EasyEnsembleClassifier for class imbalance.
3. **Model Training**: Built a Random Forest classifier and evaluated with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Tools
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The model achieved high accuracy, balancing precision and recall effectively to minimize false positives and negatives.

## Usage
- Clone the repository and install dependencies.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the workflow.
